DC_Electronics_Capstone_2019_GroupD

This repo was created to provide source control for the Capstone Project of Group D from Durham College Electronics Engineering Technology Program graduating in 2019.

The project aims to implement a smart register system which communicates to the main thermostat and gives the thermostat an idea about what the register is sensing so that the thermostat can compensate intelligently about losses in the system.
